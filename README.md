# Seoul-E-Bike

## Overview
An analysis project focused on understanding and predicting bike-sharing trends in Seoul using machine learning techniques.

## Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Predictive modeling with `scikit-learn`
- Analysis of weather, holidays, and seasonal impacts on bike rentals

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data.
2. **EDA**: Visualize trends and relationships.
3. **Modeling**: Train models and evaluate performance.
4. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like MAE and RMSE for assessment.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Future Work
Enhancements could include external data integration, web app deployment, or using deep learning for better predictions.
